# Install Gitpod Self-Hosted

The current way to install Gitpod on your own Kubernetes cluster is using the Gitpod installer. You will find guides for our supported platforms on the following pages:

- [Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS)](./installation/on-amazon-eks)
- [Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)](./installation/on-gke)
- [Microsoft Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)](./installation/on-microsoft-aks)

For more information see the [README.md](https://github.com/gitpod-io/gitpod/blob/main/install/installer/README.md) of our Installer.

> ⚠️ The prefered way to install Gitpod will most likely change around mid-April 2022. We will still use the Gitpod Installer but wrap it in a more user-friendly way. Stay tuned!
