With lots of movement in remote development and Gitpod doubling in size over the last 6 months, we‚Äôve come a long way over the past years to get closer to our mission:

<Quote quote="Remove all friction from the developer experience to be always ready-to-code and making software engineering more collaborative, joyful, and secure." type="blog"/>

With that in mind, we‚Äôve taken some time to reflect on and sharpen our core values. While most companies do have a set of values, for many they‚Äôre not very helpful as they‚Äôre not being lived. Values should help guide everyone making decisions autonomously. Values present a trade off and are ideally not generally applicable to other companies. They should be phrased in a way that it‚Äôs clear that something has to be given up in order to achieve them, almost like implicitly defining [Anti-Values](https://willsewell.com/posts/2022-02-15-what-are-your-companys-anti-values.html). If that‚Äôs not given, chances are high they are not much more than words on a page.

Gitpod is not your regular company, but a fully distributed [open source](https://www.gitpod.io/blog/opensource) developer tools startup with employees around the globe. We are also very opinionated about [how we work](https://www.notion.so/gitpod/How-we-work-0f9159f282d24f9d9776372e0c7dbab4). These characteristics directly influenced our core values that define who we are. They are an authentic representation of where we are coming from and a guiding compass on where we are going. They are horizontal to our work, our community, and the products and services crafted on Gitpod. As we are growing, who we are matures side-by-side and while some of these values stay with us, others will need to be adapted over time.

<FigHeader image={{src: '/images/blog/gitpod-core-values/we.png', alt: "Avatars for two people together"}} title="We, not me" text="We show up for the team, not for ourselves. We trust and empower each other. We make heroes and unblock others." />

- Psychological safety and diversity of gender, race, thought, and otherwise are foundational for high-performing teams. When people feel safe and know they are valued for who they are, everything they produce becomes excellent. We make equitable space at the table.
- Ego is the enemy - we think more about each other than ourselves. In turn, you get a team that is rooting for you every single day.
- Asynchronous work allows for more time to build and less time wasted in meetings. It is inclusive for our global team and enables collaboration, no matter the timezone.

<FigHeader image={{src: '/images/blog/gitpod-core-values/integrate.png', alt: "Integrate"}} title="Integrate, don‚Äôt dictate" text="We are humble and kind. We first seek to understand, then be understood - with products and people around us." />

- Orthogonality is baked into our product design and [How we work](https://www.notion.so/gitpod/How-we-work-0f9159f282d24f9d9776372e0c7dbab4). We don't build new solutions if there is an existing widely adopted one. We strive for sane reusable abstractions that can be composed in ways we haven't anticipated. We build on the success of others.
- Our community is the heartbeat of Gitpod. Their feedback drives our product and helps shape how and what we prioritize. We are committed to fostering connection by supporting and empowering our community.
- Build in the open. Transparency helps build a community of trust. Openness creates access between Gitpod and our community helping us stay ahead. [Public when possible, private when necessary](https://www.notion.so/How-we-work-0f9159f282d24f9d9776372e0c7dbab4).

<FigHeader image={{src: '/images/blog/gitpod-core-values/students.png', alt: "Book"}} title="Students of the game" text="We build and learn in the open - always with curiosity. We invest in our personal and professional development." />

- A culture of feedback helps us grow. With positive intent and selflessness in mind, we freely and respectfully give and receive feedback to better ourselves and Gitpod as a whole.
- We stay entrepreneurial developing resilience and agility. We commit to being stretched and increase our tolerance in adversity.
- We operate as [managers of one](https://www.notion.so/How-we-work-0f9159f282d24f9d9776372e0c7dbab4), taking personal responsibility for commitments, growth, and development. Everyone takes ownership of their responsibilities and is accountable for accomplishing them.

<FigHeader image={{src: '/images/blog/gitpod-core-values/skateboard.png', alt: "Skateboard with Gitpod logo on it."}} title="Ship skateboards" text="We tackle hard problems with simple solutions that delight. We commit and ship the minimal viable change, then iterate quickly." />

- Ship it. We can produce value only when we put our work in front of users. Work in progress amounts to cost; loose ends never pay back those costs. Only when we ship things does our work pay off.
- Minimal viable change. The simplest and quickest solution to a problem is often the best solution. We break problems down as small as possible to create the biggest impact. We build skateboards, then cars and we don‚Äôt stop there.
- Impeccable agreements. Trust with each other is vital to ship. We are committed to doing what we say we‚Äôll do and communicating when something changes.

Ship Skateb‚Ä¶. wait, what? Yes, that‚Äôs right. For values to be helpful in people‚Äôs day to day, habits need to be formed around them. They have to be memorable and easy to reference. When we announced the core values during our offsite in Portugal, we gave every Gitpodder an actual Gitpod skateboard with a print of our value 3D icons and a hanger to put the deck on the wall. We‚Äôve also included the icons as Emojis in Slack and it‚Äôs amazing to see how frequently they already get referenced by people - ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the skateboard üõπ for this problem?‚Äù seems to be common jargon. Lastly, if values feel unauthentic and are far away from how the company already operates, it will be hard to get them to be useful. As said before, they should be an authentic representation of where you are coming from and a guiding compass on where you are going.
